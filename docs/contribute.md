## Conventional Commits

This project has **conventional commit** validations. Conventional commits is a simple way of describing commit messages using a convention that allows them to be easily read by a machine.

The commits need to fit the following structure:

> `<type>[optional scope]: <description>[optional body][optional footer]`

- Type:
  - **feat** [ X.1.X - Minor] - A commit of the type feat introduces a new feature to the codebase
  - **fix** [ X.X.1 - Patch] - A commit of the type fix patches a bug in your codebase
  - **chore** - updating grunt tasks etc; no production code change
  - **docs** - A commit with documentation updates
  - **refactor** - A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
  - improvement [X.X.X - N/A] - Commits that improve a current implementation without adding a new feature or fixing a bug

Itâ€™s important to notice the **feat** and **fix** types bump up the version of the project correlating to a **MINOR** and **PATCH** (accordingly) in semantic versioning.

- Scope: Short description of a section of the codebase enclosed in parenthesis followed by a colon and a space

- Description: Add alternative footer to the homepage
Short description of the code changes

- Body: Implement the alternative version of the footer(â€¦)
A longer description of the commit, providing additional context about the changes.

- **BREAKING CHANGE**: BREAKING CHANGE [1.X.X - Major]
Must be indicated at the very beginning of the footer or body section of a commit and consist of the uppercase text BREAKING CHANGE, followed by a colon and a space.
It bumps up the version of the project correlating to a MAJOR in semantic versioning
