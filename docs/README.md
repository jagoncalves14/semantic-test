Gatsby is a React-based, GraphQL powered, static site generator. Gatsby combines the best parts of React, webpack, react-router, GraphQL, and other front-end tools in to one very enjoyable developer experience.

Gatsby builds a website that uses only static files for incredibly fast page loads, service workers, code splitting, server-side rendering, intelligent image loading, asset optimization, and data prefetching. **All out of the box.**

GraphQL is a query language for your API, and a server-side runtime for executing queries by using a type system you define for your data. GraphQL isn't tied to any specific database or storage engine and is instead backed by your existing code and data.
